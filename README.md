I tried to make this projects with the help and FreeCodeCamp instructors!

### Create a new repository on the command line

The following are codes for pushing my stuffs on GitHub

```
echo "# fcc-2023-frontend-projects" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <https://github.com/Gadrawingz/fcc-2023-frontend-projects.git>

```
